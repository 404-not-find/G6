The leaves will be aligned on the same level. This algorithm does not consider the node size, which means all the nodes will be regarded as unit size with 1px.

## Usage
Dendrogram is an appropriate layout method for tree data structure. Please use it with TreeGraph. As the demo below, you can deploy it in `layout` while instantiating Graph. it can also be used for [Subgraph Layout](https://www.yuque.com/antv/g6/qopkkg#eYZc6).

You can set different configurations for different nodes if the parameter is Function type. Please refer to the ducuments for more information.
