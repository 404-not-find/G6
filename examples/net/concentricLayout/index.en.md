Concentric Layout places the nodes on concentric circles.

## Usage

As the demo below, you can deploy it in `layout` while instantiating Graph. it can also be used for [Subgraph Layout](https://www.yuque.com/antv/g6/qopkkg#eYZc6). This algorithm will order the nodes according to the parameters first, then the node in the front of the order will be place on the center of the concentric circles.
