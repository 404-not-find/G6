Classical MDS（Multidemensional Scaling）is a algorithm for high dimensional data projuection. Relational data layout problem can be regarded as projecting high dimensional data onto a 2D visual space.

## Usage

As the demo below, you can deploy it in `layout` while instantiating Graph. it can also be used for [Subgraph Layout](https://www.yuque.com/antv/g6/qopkkg#eYZc6). By tuning the parameters, you can adjust the iteration number, compact degree, layout buy cluster, and so on. By tuning the parameters, you can adjust the edge length.
